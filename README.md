# [SigScale](http://www.sigscale.org) 5GC Charging Function (CHF)

This application implements the Charging Function (CHF) of a decomposed
Converged Charging System (CCS) (3GPP TS 32.296) within a 3GPP 5G Core
network. The Re interface to a remote Rating Function (RF) (e.g.
[SigScale OCS](https://github.com/sigscale/ocs)) is accomplished with the
[NRF_Rating](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/SigScale/nrf-rating/1.1.0)
API.
