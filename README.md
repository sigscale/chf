# [SigScale](http://www.sigscale.org) Converged Charging Function (CHF)

This application implements the Converged Charging Function (CHF)
of a decomposed Converged Charging System (CCS) (3GPP TS 32.296)
within a 3GPP 5G Core network. The Re interface to a remote Rating
Function (RF) (e.g. [SigScale OCS](https://github.com/sigscale/ocs))
is accomplished with the
[NRF_Rating](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/SigScale/nrf-rating/1.0.0)
API.
